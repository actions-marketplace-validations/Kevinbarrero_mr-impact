# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-11-12

### Added

- **Look at first:** a `👉 **Look at first:** …` line names up to three rows, riskiest first, each with why (`untested, 3 callers`, `added lines not measured`), then `+N` for the rest, so a reviewer starts in the right place.
- **Compact layout:** above 20 rows the table shows every 🔴 row and the first 10 🟡 rows (rows rated by `added lines not measured` taken last, here and in Look at first), and all other rows go in a second table under `<details>`; the 50-row cap covers both tables together and no row appears twice.
- **`📦 go.work` line:** when the head is built in a Go workspace, the note states the `go.work` in effect, the other modules it uses (and whether the analysed module requires or replaces them), and that the base was built from `go.mod`. A `go.work` that uses only the analysed module reads ``📦 go.work: `go.work` (no other modules)``; a `--dir` reached through a symlink no longer lists itself as another module.
- **Moved branches:** a removed branch whose exact text is added in another function now names it: ``body (branch moved to `pkg.F`)`` when every removed branch moved, ``(branch removed · 1 of 3 moved to `pkg.F`)`` when some did. A function whose removed branches all moved is no longer held by the branch-removed rule. A destination counts when the branch starts on an added line or lies in a function new in this MR. A generic branch (`return nil`, `return err`, `if err != nil`, `default`, …) moves only to a function the changed function's head body calls or uses as a value; each added copy accounts for one removed branch across all functions, taken in name order.

### Changed

- **Static mode (no coverprofile):** a function with added lines that a test reaches is 🟡, not 🟢, because whether the added lines ran is not measured; its cover cell reads `reached by test · added lines not measured`. A function with no added lines that a test reaches reads `no added lines · reached by test` and stays 🟢. A degraded run without a call graph is unchanged (`n/a`). When such a function also lost a branch, its reason is `branch removed`, so Look at first does not rank it with the unmeasured rows.
- **Legend:** the footer rules now say 🟡 includes "added lines not measured" and 🟢 is "covered, or no added lines and reached by a test".

### Fixed

- A changed function in another module of a `go.work` workspace reads `Not analyzed: … (in another module: <path>)`, not `(build tags)`.
- Methods the standard library calls on interface values (`Error`, `Unwrap` through `errors.Is`/`errors.As`, `String`, `ServeHTTP`, …) count as reached by a test that converts their type to an interface; before, they read `not reached` and no callers. These edges never count as callers.
- The base revision is loaded with `GOWORK=off`, from its own `go.mod`, so a `go.work` that exists only at the head (or names modules the base lacks) no longer fails the base load.

## [v0.3.2] - 2026-11-11

### Added

- **Routes:** registration calls render as the route they register (`GET /trade/:id`), with `Group`/`Route`/`PathPrefix`/`Prefix` prefixes followed through locals of the same function (a router taken from a parameter, receiver or field starts the path with `…`, as in `POST …/trade`: its outer prefixes are set elsewhere), in the Entry points column and every registration block; only path literals (`/x`, `"GET /x"`, `""` under a `/` prefix) render, and anything ambiguous keeps the call text.
- **Registrations changed:** a registration that keeps its call and handler but gains or loses other arguments (a middleware, an option) is listed once under `🔌 **Registrations changed**` as `+ a, − b`, instead of as removed plus added. A route moved to another group prefix stays removed plus added.
- **Uncovered added lines:** in coverprofile mode, a collapsed list under the table gives the uncovered added line ranges of each 🔴 and 🟡 row and of the functions folded into it; rows reached only by tests in other packages are not listed.

### Fixed

- A function is sensitive only when an added line touches the sensitive call (multi-line calls included) or it lies in a `critical` package; 🔐 lists only the touched APIs. An unrelated edit to a function that calls `db.Ping()` no longer marks it sensitive.
- Handlers passed to a variadic registration (`GET("/x", mw, h)`) resolve to that call, so middleware-wrapped routes are registrations and entry points.
- `make` and `new` type arguments (`make(map[string]int)`) and generic instantiations no longer stop a constructor from being wiring. A constructor with a `context.Context` parameter is still never wiring (unchanged rule).

## [v0.3.1] - 2026-11-10

### Changed

- The GitHub Action's Marketplace name is now `mrimpact for Go` (the name `mrimpact` is taken in the Marketplace). Usage is unchanged: `uses: Kevinbarrero/mr-impact@v0`.

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-11-10

The first public release. Earlier versions were internal and never published.

### Added

- **The note.** One risk-ranked note per merge request: the changed functions (new, body, signature), their callers up to `--depth` from an SSA/VTA call graph, the coverage of the added lines from coverprofiles (or static test reach without one), a Mermaid diagram with a legend, deleted functions, changed declarations and touched tests. Updated in place on every run.
- **Detectors for what a change leaves behind:** removed `case` arms whose value still exists, code now unused or only used by tests, config fields no longer read, generated code no longer used, and registrations (routes, subscriptions, hooks, commands) removed, rewired or added.
- **Signal:** cross-package test reach (a coverage hint when a coverprofile was made without `-coverpkg`), the `wiring` kind for straight-line setup (at most 🟡), and new-code groups folded into the row of the function that enters them.
- **Reach and focus:** the 🔐 sensitive-code section with a default table of standard-library and common data-access and crypto APIs (untested sensitive code is 🔴), the Entry points column (registrations, exported API, `main`, `init`), and an optional, strict `.mrimpact.yml` (`critical` globs, `sensitive` add/remove) with a config line that states what the MR changed in it.
- **Architecture:** the 🏛 section judges the package import graph against layer rules: zero-config inferred hints, presets (`clean`, `onion`, `hexagonal`, `ddd`, `layered`, `mvc`, `pipeline`, `modular`) or custom layers, isolated layers, new violations with file and line, conformance and Martin coupling metrics base → head, and the `--fail-on arch` gate.
- **GitHub pull requests:** detection from the Actions event, one issue comment upserted by marker and author (`MRIMPACT_COMMENT_AUTHOR`), the job summary, and fork pull requests handled without posting.
- **Distribution:** the GitHub Action `Kevinbarrero/mr-impact@v0`, the GitLab template `ci/mrimpact.gitlab-ci.yml`, release archives for linux, darwin and windows (amd64, arm64) with `checksums.txt`, and `install.sh`, which verifies the checksum before installing.
- `--version`, `--fail-on red,arch`, `--skip-empty`, `--strict`, `--config`.

### Changed

- The module path is `github.com/Kevinbarrero/mr-impact`; the command stays `mrimpact`.
- The version comes from the release build, or from the module's build info for `go install`; the note's footer reads `mrimpact <version>`.
- The shallow-clone error names both fixes: `GIT_DEPTH: 0` on GitLab and `fetch-depth: 0` on GitHub.
- The README is short; the full reference moved to `docs/reference.md`.
- Licensed under Apache-2.0.

### Fixed

- The diff is taken against the merge base of base and head, not the base tip.
- Parameter and result renames are not reported as signature changes.
- Packages with only non-type errors (such as `go:embed`) are still analysed.
- Callers are deduplicated by function and package; a closure's callers are not counted as the enclosing function's.
- A group is never rated below its red entry, and a function red on its own is never folded.
- A function taking `context.Context` is never wiring, and wiring inspects closure bodies.
- The inferred architecture section no longer appears when no package outside `entry` is classified; isolation compares adapter units, not sibling packages.
- `git` runs with `LC_ALL=C`; error-response bodies from the forge are capped at 1 MiB; no post is attempted without a token.
