<details><summary>⚠️ Limits of this analysis</summary>

- Calls via `reflect` or dynamic registration (e.g. handlers by name) are not detected.
- This repo only: callers in other services (HTTP/gRPC) are not visible.
- Functions called only from dependencies (e.g. HTTP handlers registered with net/http) or from package-level initializers show no callers (methods the standard library calls on interface values, such as `Error`, `Unwrap` or `ServeHTTP`, count as reached from the code that converts their type to an interface; see the list in the reference); where such a function is registered is listed under Registered.
- Now unused: uses through `reflect`, `//go:linkname` or other repositories are not seen; exported methods, and exported functions of packages other modules can import, are never listed.
