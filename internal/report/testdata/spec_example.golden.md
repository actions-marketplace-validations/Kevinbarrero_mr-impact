### 🔍 MR impact — 4 functions changed
**🔴 2 · 🟡 1 · 🟢 1** · coverage: `coverprofile` · base `a1b2c3d`

👉 **Look at first:** `pricing.(*Calculator).Total` · `orders.applyDiscount` · `orders.Validate`

| Risk | Function | Change | Callers | Added-line coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴 | `pricing.(*Calculator).Total` | signature (exported) | 14 (4 pkgs) | 0 % (0/12) |
| 🔴 | `orders.applyDiscount` | body | 5 | 0 % (0/7) |
| 🟡 | `orders.Validate` | body | 2 | 40 % (2/5) |
| 🟢 | `httpapi.formatDate` | new | 1 | 100 % (4/4) |

➖ Deleted: `legacy.OldTotal`

🧪 Tests touched in this MR: `orders/validate_test.go`

**How to read the diagram:** coloured boxes are functions this MR changed (🔴 not tested · 🟡 partly tested, branch removed or added lines not measured · 🟢 tested); plain boxes are callers the MR did not change; an arrow points from a caller to the function it calls; a dashed arrow means the function is passed as a callback (registered) and called through it. Every caller is listed under *All callers*.

<details><summary>⚠️ Limits of this analysis</summary>

- Calls via `reflect` or dynamic registration (e.g. handlers by name) are not detected.
- This repo only: callers in other services (HTTP/gRPC) are not visible.
- Functions called only from dependencies (e.g. HTTP handlers registered with net/http) or from package-level initializers show no callers (methods the standard library calls on interface values, such as `Error`, `Unwrap` or `ServeHTTP`, count as reached from the code that converts their type to an interface; see the list in the reference); where such a function is registered is listed under Registered.
- Now unused: uses through `reflect`, `//go:linkname` or other repositories are not seen; exported methods, and exported functions of packages other modules can import, are never listed.
